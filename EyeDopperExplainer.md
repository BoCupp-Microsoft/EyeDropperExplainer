# Hi 

## Motivation

Currently, desktop versions of apps with eyedroppers have many different features which have motivated our solution. Some of them are: preview of pixel color, averaging of surrounding pixels, and adding eyedropper colors to a queue inside of a color box.

## Goals 

- Allow image editing applications to implement eyedropper functionality which can pick color from one pixel and is customizable for the user 
- The eyedropper will be able to provide a preview when clicked on (all info contained within the browser) 
- Allow the user to cancel selection via Escape key 
- Create a tool that is secure and will prevent privacy issues (only send info to site when clicked) 
## Non-Goals
- Allow the user to have a color picker screen to choose color from 
- Developing the UI and functionality of an eyedropper
