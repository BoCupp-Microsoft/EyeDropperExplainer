## Introduction
Currently on the web, creative application developers are unable to implement eyedropper functionality. This explainer proposes a web-based API that enables developers to build eyedropper-like tools in their web apps. 

## Problem

Several creative applications would like to utilize the ability to pick a color from pixels on the screen. Many cross-platform applications, e.g. Powerpoint, have eyedroppper functionality on their native app but are unable to carry it over the web.      
   
Although some browsers have built-in eyedropper functionality into color input tags. This limits customizability and can be seen as being out of place for many applications.
